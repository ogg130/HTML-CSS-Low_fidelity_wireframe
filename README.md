# tourism_site_wireframe

Basic quasi-Responsive HTML and CSS wireframe designed in a day for a college course project to make a wireframe for a tourism website.

The purpose of this project is to provide a basic wireframe used do prototype the UI/UX of a site for agile development. 

The site is designed using the persona of Jack, a retiree who will be making a return visit to the island with his wife on his second honeymoon, as a guideline for the sites navigation elements and look and feel.

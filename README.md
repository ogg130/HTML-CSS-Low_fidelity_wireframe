Basic quasi-Responsive low-fidelity HTML and CSS wireframe designed in under a day for a college course project to make a wireframe for a tourism website.

The purpose of this project is to provide a basic wireframe used do prototype the UI/UX of a site for agile development. 

The site is designed using the persona of Jack ([Jacks Persona Profile](https://github.com/ogg130/low_fidelity_html_css_wireframe/blob/master/Persona-Jack.pdf)), a retiree who will be making a return visit to the island with his wife on his second honeymoon, as a guideline for the sites navigation elements and look and feel.
